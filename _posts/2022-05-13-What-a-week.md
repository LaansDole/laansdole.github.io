## CodeTalk 3: What a week it has been

Truly what a hell of a week!!

I have to confess something first though.

There is this old and very bad habit of mine that if I'm close to some kind of deadline, I won't be in the right mind to do anything else until the dealine is gone or done or finished. Like, I could just spend days in my room and be over-thinking about it. In other word, I procrastinate my happiness until after the deadline. 

That's why, I...haven't done any HackerRank for the past week. In my defense, I did look at code and stuffs, like I didn't completely lost touch with programming you know, I just had other things on my mind that makes me feel procrastinate to do some practices. Some of them are even health problems but I will get to that part later.

So the deadline that I'm gonna have here is my riding exam, which has two parts: MCQ and practical. If the exam day hadn't been moved to next week, I wouldn't be wrting this blog as I still feel unconfident about both my knowledge and my skill. Don't get me wrong, I did work hard for the exam in the past week, I'm just uncertain about my one-month experience in riding a motorbike. Even though I have been spending at least two hours a day practicing in last week, it's hard to find confident when I still struggled and made mistakes during trial run. Nevertheless, this may sound weird but being imperfect somehow motivates me to keep practicing more and more until I'm close to perfection and actually pass the practical flawlessly.

Anyway, with the motorbike exam on my mind, my life then took a few more turns and throw in some health issues, deciding it would be literally and figuratively a painful week. It's been a while since my tongue gets hurt, but when it does, it hurts so bad that I cannot even talk or eat anything. Even drinking water is a new form of pain endurance. If that's not enough to ruin anybody's day, here comes the neck-ache. I even thought my neck broke at one point as the stiffness and the pain didn't wear off after two days, thanks god I felt way better on my fourth day.

I'm fine now. Thanks for asking.

After those events, I realise health is really underrated when you're young. I had neck-ache in my 20, imagine how worse it could be in the next 10 years if I become a developer. It scares me to think to be honest. I hate to say this but my mom is right. The sooner you realise about how important your health is, the better your future. Think about it, would it make any sense if you spend all the money you make on medicines? Of course not right! Therefore, be more concious about your health from now on and you will thank your past-self in the future. 

Let's wrap up this episode with the last update on my life. Right now I'm reading a book called " Hello các bạn mình là tôi đi code dạo " by author Phạm Huy Hoàng, so far it's been quite interesting and realistic about the whole Computer Science Major myths and claims. Stay tuned for the next episode as I'm gonna dicuss some of the contents in the book that I feel related. 

P/s: Boy do I miss writing a blog, I feel like this is the only way I can express myself these days. Sorry if this CodeTalk episode is quite boring or ranting, I'm still learning how to tell the story more interesting.
