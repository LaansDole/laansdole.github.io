Hi, Welcome to my Daily Dose of Coding, 

where I will show every coding-related stuffs I did/have been doing/going to do. 

Quick introduction, I am RMIT student, majoring in Information Technology and minor in Web Development (at least that's what I plan anyway).

My dream is to become a Software Engineer and until then, I still have lots and lots to learn.
